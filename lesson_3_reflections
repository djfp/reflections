This is my lesson 3 reflections sheet

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- using 2 computers
- sharing work with others
- backup in the cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because things may not be ready to be published to third parties

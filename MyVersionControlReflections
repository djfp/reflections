my reflections

missed the first one, but will be sage now

I'll try to use version control with other kinds of documents than code

Saving when intended is good, but there should also be an autosave - locally, so that I don't loose any work ever.

No issue to commit a potential error as I can roll back at any time

I'd like to control this document with Version Control (GIT)
